1- I would keep them remote if I need to work on them with other people or wish to access
   them from various places.

2- Because I might have modified the local version and pulling would cause the
   modifications to be changed back to their original state.

3- Branch: is used to make a version of the work without affecting the main version.
   Clone: is a copy of the work usually used to copy a repository from GitHub to be
   accessed locally.
   Fork: is a type of clone used internally within GitHub where you can clone another
   repository to your account with a link to the original.

4- It minimise the probability of losing some work and ease in resolving conflicts when the
   local copy has a set of modifications and the remote copy has another set of
   modifications.

5- I would send the basic files to the other collaborators and give each a task to fulfil
   then combine the different versions to gather and fix any bugs. It would be easier to
   use Git for the purpose as it can minimise errors and save time.
